    "# Animal Classifier CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The following file will integrate a CNN aiming at using the `Animals-10` dataset in order to correctly classify them according to their species. Multiple different hyper parameters, transformations and models will be used through transfer learning to test out different configurations and determine which configuration leads to the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to maintain the code clean, the project will incorporate several helper functions, and will be modularized in the `utils` folder to keep the `main.ipynb` file as clean as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, the structure can be seen in the outline where after setting up the foundations, the project will focus on tweaking parameters and assessing their performance through tensor board and our own manual prints. \n",
